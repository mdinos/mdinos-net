My first blog post is absolutely substanceless. There is **absolutely** nothing to be gained by reading this post.

- Lists exist for many things
- Those things will _NOT_ be explained in this blog

I suppose if you read this, you have a taste for the pointless. I congratulate you.

```hcl
resource "something" "name" {
    something = "this"
    really_long_variable_name = "some_really::long_value::AWS::something"
}
```
